#CAD

Here is part of my production with Solidworks. If you don't have software that can view a .STEP, some websites like https://beta.sharecad.org/ may do the trick.

#### 4pots.STEP

It is the CAD file of a personal project aborted due to non-profitability.

#### GD R + C.STEP

This is the CAD of a cart and a cooler that I developed during my job at Technosoud. They are currently produced and sold by this company.

#### base mobile.STEP

I've done this device during a scholar project.

#### belt_system_V2.STEP

Here is the Sony CSL robot I've worked on during my last internship.
